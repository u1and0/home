`hsdev`  branch is now merged into `master`
There are many changes, so it's highly recommended to read updated [README](https://github.com/SublimeHaskell/SublimeHaskell/)

You have to install `hsdev` package (`cabal install hsdev`; will be available on stack soon too), add it to `PATH` (or by using `add_to_PATH` setting) and then you'll be able to use all `SublimeHaskell: ...` commands.
